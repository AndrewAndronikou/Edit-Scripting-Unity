# Editor-Scripting-Unity

As I started to create larger game projects, I realised that designing levels, characters etc. became cumbersome so by creating tools that would aid the design process this made the whole process much more manageable.

The enemy class creator is a tool created to assist me with creating various classes, specializations, weapons etc. This utilizes scriptable objects and character data to retrieve the relevant variables for that class, this allowed me to rapidly create prefab enemy classes to use in my games.
